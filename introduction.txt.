Hello! My name is Elizabeth Aywaki. I hold a Bachelor of Commerce degree with a specialization in Finance. I'm currently half-way through the ALX pathways, which is proving to be an exciting journey in my professional development.

I'm keen on leveraging my financial background with new skills, and I'm looking forward to applying what I learn from my ALX program in practical projects. This repository, MyFirstRepo, is a step in that direction as I explore and document my progress.
Currently, I'm halfway through the ALX pathways, an intensive program that's significantly expanding my skill set. I'm excited about the practical knowledge and real-world application this journey offers, and I look forward to integrating these new capabilities with my finance background in future projects and endeavors.
